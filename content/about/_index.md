I’m Ovais Akhter, a software product manager living near Copenhagen, Denmark. With 24 years of experience in tech, I’ve gone from writing code to managing products like Jabra+, a platform that keeps devices happy (and users happier). I’m a logical thinker with a soft spot for empathy and equality, and when I’m not navigating the tech world, you’ll find me cooking for my family or pondering how AI might change everything… again.
