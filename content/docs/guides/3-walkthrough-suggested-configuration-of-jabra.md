#### Walkthrough: Suggested configuration of Jabra+

At this point, you have completed the Quick Start Guide and provisioned Jabra personal or meeting room devices. You or other relevant admin users can now configure the Jabra+ platform.

When Jabra devices are provisioned, they are added to the device inventory or room inventory and are automatically assigned a default standard configuration, which is a collection of Jabrarecommended settings that include a default firmware policy.

Admin users can begin remote management with Jabra's default configuration or optionally customize it to suit the organization's needs.

If an admin user manages a few Jabra personal or meeting room devices, they can adjust settings remotely of a single Jabra meeting room device or adjust settings remotely of a single Jabra personal device, without using a predetermined configuration and/or without having the Jabra device in a grouping (such as locations).

However, if you have many Jabra devices, you can follow the suggested configuration.

The following procedures are optional and are only a suggested way of configuring the platform and having more control over your Jabra devices in Jabra+.

## For Jabra personal devices

- - Pair your Bluetooth Jabra personal devices to the USB dongle (Jabra Link Bluetooth adapter)
- - Create device group(s) and sort Jabra personal devices

## For Jabra meeting room devices

- - Add a locations structure based on how the business organization is organized.
- - Move your unassigned rooms into locations and add details to rooms
- - Defining a schedule for Jabra meeting room device updates

## Other optional tasks to complete for both personal and meeting room devices

- - Configurations: use standard configuration with or without exceptions (For Personal or Meeting room devices) or create one i.e.: Create a configuration/Create a room configuration
- - Assigning a configuration or Bulk assigning a previously created room configuration to many rooms
- - Firmware: You can customize firmware policies in configurations to suit your needs
- - Enable or disable firmware management
- - Choose whether you want to Modify & set the firmware policy for specific Jabra device models
- - Choose a specific firmware version for your Jabra devices to use, and others.

For reference information and to understand all the capabilities of the platform, see the Jabra+ platform management chapter.
