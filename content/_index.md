Welcome to Bayaaliis—inspired by the Urdu word for '42,' famously known as the answer to life, the universe, and everything in *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*. Here, '42' is more than a number; it’s a call to uncover deeper insights.

As a Product Person, I’m passionate about the transformative potential of Generative AI and its impact on the tech landscape. Join me as we explore the intersections of technology and privacy with logic, skepticism, and curiosity—celebrating the joys of family, cooking, and equality along the way.

Let’s discover our own "42" in everything we do.
