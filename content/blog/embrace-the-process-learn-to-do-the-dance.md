In every field, especially in areas driven by complex and evolving challenges like technology and business, processes are not just tools—they are the distilled wisdom of countless experts and practitioners who came before us. It's easy to overlook the value of established methodologies, mistaking them for rigid constraints. However, these processes are akin to well-tested recipes created by master chefs, and there is much to learn from first following the recipe as it is. ​Why 'Do the Dance'? ​ The idea of "doing the dance" with a process means engaging with it fully and faithfully when first implementing it. By adhering to the process as designed, we not only respect the collective intelligence that shaped it but also set a baseline against which we can measure our outcomes effectively. This initial fidelity allows us to understand the process's core benefits and drawbacks in its purest form. Respecting Collective Wisdom The processes we encounter in professional settings are not arbitrary; they are the culmination of many intelligent minds solving complex problems. By initially applying these processes precisely as intended, we honor the efforts of those who developed them. This approach aligns with the core principles of the scientific method, which has propelled human inquiry for centuries: hypothesize, test faithfully, observe, and adjust based on evidence. Tailoring with Insight Once we've fully engaged with the process and understood its impacts, we're in a better position to make informed adjustments. These tweaks are not based on mere preference but on clear data derived from our experiences. This methodical adjustment phase allows us to customize processes in a way that enhances productivity and outcome consistency, all while maintaining a foundation in proven practice. Measure, Adapt, and Improve I encourage everyone to first "do the dance" - immerse yourself fully in established processes before attempting to alter them. This approach ensures that any changes are thoughtful, data-driven, and likely to result in genuine improvements. By doing so, we not only leverage historical wisdom but also contribute to its evolution, ensuring it remains relevant and effective in meeting the unique challenges of our times.
