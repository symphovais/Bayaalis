I’m writing this blog because I know it’s common for our sales and support teams to feel puzzled when a requested feature doesn’t make it into the next release or takes longer than expected. My goal is to shed light on why certain features are prioritized over others and to explain the balancing act we go through in product management.

In some ways, this process is like the prioritization decisions we all make in our daily lives. Take a visit to the doctor, for example. Sometimes, you’ll be told to “wait and see,” which is a judgment call based on urgency and risk. Or think about planning home improvements—you might start with insulation rather than the garden, not because the garden doesn’t matter, but because insulation has an immediate impact on your home’s comfort and energy efficiency. In both cases, prioritization comes down to weighing different factors to make the best choice with the resources available.

Product management operates on similar principles, but the factors are more complex, and our decisions have ripple effects that impact customers, internal teams, and the business as a whole. When a new feature request comes in, we first look at its potential impact on customers. A feature that serves a larger number of users will typically be weighted higher than one addressing a niche need, as it aligns with our goal of maximizing value for the most people.

Business goals also influence these decisions. Certain features support strategic growth areas, helping us maintain competitiveness and meet market needs, so they may receive prioritized attention. Technical feasibility is another key consideration—while some ideas sound simple, they might involve complex engineering work or come with risks. In these cases, we evaluate whether the value justifies the effort required.

Equally important is ensuring alignment with our product vision. We’re not just stacking up functions but aiming to build a cohesive experience that serves our users’ needs. Finally, resource constraints play a role, and effort estimation helps us make realistic choices. Some features require significant resources, which sometimes means prioritizing quicker wins that can deliver immediate value to customers.

Our approach to prioritization isn’t set in stone; it’s a dynamic process. As we gain new insights from customers and receive feedback from sales, we adjust our roadmap to address the most pressing needs. This flexibility allows us to stay responsive and ensures our choices remain relevant.

For our colleagues in sales and support, please know that product management’s role isn’t about saying “no” or delaying your requests. It’s about balancing priorities to deliver maximum value within constraints. We’re your partners in this process, and through open communication and collaboration, we’re working toward the best outcomes for our customers and our business.
