I've always been a bit of a workaholic. Late nights, constant pressure, the whole nine yards. Add a bad habit like smoking to the mix, and it is a recipe for disaster. Then, one day, I snapped. My doctor diagnosed me with severe stress and prescribed both medication and counseling. Suddenly, I had something called "imposter syndrome" – this feeling of never being good enough or a fraud. I lost all my motivation. I didn't want to do anything, and basic tasks felt like climbing a mountain. But through it all, my family stood by me. My wife offered unwavering support, and my children... well, they just kept being kids. They didn't treat me differently; that unintentional normalcy was a lifeline. I also received incredible support from work. I'm so grateful to be in a country like Denmark, where mental health is understood and prioritized. It's been a long road, but I'm finally feeling like myself again. I've developed a deep respect for the importance of work-life balance. Sure, I'm still the same slightly grumpy guy, but I'm learning to let go of the unimportant things. Tips for Managing Stress If you're struggling with stress, here's what helped me: Ask for help: Talk to a doctor, therapist, or trusted friend/family member. Don't go through this alone. Prioritize self-care: Sleep well, eat healthily, and try activities like meditation or exercise. Set boundaries: Learn to say "no" and protect your time and energy. Find joy: Dedicate time to hobbies and things that truly bring you happiness. Be kind to yourself: Recovery takes time. Give yourself grace. Remember, you are not alone. By sharing our stories, we can break down stigma and help each other find healthier, happier lives.
