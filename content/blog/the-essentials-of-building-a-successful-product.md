The formula for a great product is more nuanced than just having a good idea. Let's simplify it into a mantra: "Understand Customer Problems, Start Simple, Deliver Solutions, Measure Continuously, Adapt and Respond Quickly and Constantly." Understand Customer Problems Know your customer's pain points to make informed decisions, it is all about finding problems that are worth solving and the ones customers are willing to pay. Start Simple Focus on the core functionality; build a Minimum Viable(Loveable) Product (MVP) for quick real-world testing. MVP is often mistaken by an unfinished product. For me MVP is an end to end solution to the top customer problem. Deliver Solutions, Not Features Focus on problem-solving, not feature-adding. Provide actual value to your customers. Measure Continuously Use data-driven decisions to guide improvements and understand performance. Every epic should come with KPIs which should be measured. Adapt and Respond Quickly Be flexible and responsive to changing conditions and feedback. Constantly Iterate Product development is an ongoing process. Keep refining based on customer feedback and data. Building a successful product is a continuous cycle of understanding, simplifying, delivering, measuring, and adapting. Embrace this agile approach to ensure your product not only solves problems but also thrives in the market.
