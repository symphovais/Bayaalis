   - 15 gm coriander seeds, 8 gm cumin seeds, 23 gm black peppercorns, 3 gm mace, 3 gm green cardamom, 2 gm black cardamom, 2 gm cloves, 1.5 gm cinnamon stick, and 6-7 bay leaves.  
2. Grind them into a fine powder. Use **2.5 tsp** of this masala later.

#### **Step 3: Cook the Beef**

2. Add:  
   - ¾ inch cinnamon stick

   - 3 black cardamom  
   - 4-5 cloves  
   - 3 bay leaves  
3. Add the marinated beef and cook on high heat for **5-7 minutes** to sear the meat.  
4. Lower the heat, add **2 tsp prepared biryani masala** and **½ cup water**.  
5. Cover and cook until the beef is tender (**40-50 minutes**), stirring occasionally.

#### **Step 4: Cook the Rice**  
1. In a large pot, boil water and add:  
   - Salt to taste  
   - 2 bay leaves  
   - ¾ inch cinnamon stick  
   - 3 black cardamom  
   - 3 green cardamom  
2. Add **1.5 kg soaked Sella basmati rice** and cook until **70-80% done**. Drain and set aside.

#### **Step 5: Prepare the Jhol (Gravy)**  
In a bowl, mix together:  
- 3 tbsp fresh mint leaves (chopped)  
- 3 tbsp fresh coriander leaves (chopped)  
- ⅓ cup fried onions  
- 3 green chilies (mild, slit)  
- 1 green chili (spicy, slit)  
- ⅓ cup excess oil from the cooked beef  
- 3 tbsp fresh cream  
- 1.5 tsp prepared biryani masala  
- 2 tsp kewra water  
- Salt to taste  

---

#### **Step 6: Layer the Biryani**  
1. In a heavy-bottom pot, add half of the cooked beef as the first layer.  
2. Add half of the cooked rice.  
3. Pour half of the prepared jhol evenly over the rice. Sprinkle **1.5 tsp biryani masala**.  
4. Repeat with the remaining beef, rice, and jhol.  
5. Finish by sprinkling **3 tbsp saffron water** (soak saffron in warm water for 10 minutes), fresh mint leaves, fresh coriander leaves, and fried onions.  

---

#### **Step 7: Dum Cooking (Steam Cooking)**  
1. Cover the pot tightly with a lid or seal it with dough to trap the steam.  
2. Cook on low heat for **25-30 minutes** to allow all the flavors to meld together beautifully.  

---

### **Step 8: Serve**  
Gently fluff the biryani to mix the layers slightly, but don’t over-mix. Serve hot with raita, salad, or yogurt.  

---

### **Tips for Success**  
- Marinate the beef for longer for deeper flavors and tenderness.  
- Cook the rice only 70-80% to prevent it from getting mushy during dum cooking.  
- Adjust the spice level with the number of green chilies.  

Enjoy this delicious and aromatic **Beef Biryani** – a dish that’s guaranteed to impress your family and guests! Even if you don’t cook all the time, this recipe will make you feel like a pro chef. 😊
