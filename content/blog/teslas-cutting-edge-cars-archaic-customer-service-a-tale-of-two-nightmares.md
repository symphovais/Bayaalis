When we think of Tesla, we often associate it with innovation, sleek designs, and cutting-edge technology. However, my recent experiences with their service department have revealed an entirely different story—a story of inefficiency, poor communication, and utter lack of accountability. The Charging Fiasco The first ordeal began with a simple charging issue. My third-party charger wasn't charging my Tesla, a seemingly straightforward problem. However, it took around two months of back-and-forth communication to convince Tesla that there was an actual issue with my car. Throughout this period, my third-party charger provider was far more responsive and supportive. They replaced my charger three times and even offered me discounts on my charging costs—actions that were starkly missing from Tesla's end. Finally I practically had to take my mobile Tesla Charger to Tesla Service Service asked to use it to charge my car and then they tried and it did not work and then they finally opened a service case and fixed it, without even a hint of shame. The Door Debacle As if the first ordeal wasn't enough, a new nightmare began. My passenger car door stopped functioning. I thought, surely, a company as futuristic as Tesla would handle this basic issue efficiently. I couldn't have been more wrong. After a frustrating 35-day wait for an appointment (which they cancelled once since their app deleted the data with my request and they were not able to allocate resources), I was told that the parts to fix the door were unavailable. This wasn't just an inconvenience; it was a complete disruption of basic use of the vehicle. The Recurring Nightmare What's most disheartening is the recurring nature of these issues. These aren't isolated incidents but an ongoing pattern. One has to question: How can a company that is a leader in electric vehicle technology fall so flat when it comes to basic customer service? Is this the kind of futuristic world Tesla envisions—one where car doors don't open and customer complaints go unanswered? My experience with Tesla has been a series of unfortunate events, a far cry from the high-tech, seamless experience they advertise. It's baffling how a company that aims to revolutionize the automotive industry has a customer service department that seems stuck in the past. Until Tesla addresses these glaring issues, my advice to prospective buyers would be to approach with caution. After all, what good is cutting-edge technology if the company fails at the basic tenets of customer satisfaction? ​
