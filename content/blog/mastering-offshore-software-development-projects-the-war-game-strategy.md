In my 24 years of experience in offshore software development, I've faced numerous challenges in kick-starting projects effectively. I've worked both offshore and onshore, gaining insights into the dynamics of starting software projects in these settings. The key approach I've found effective involves a mix of onshore and offshore strategies. Initially, the project begins onshore, focusing on architecture and project management. The goal is to establish clear communication channels between the client and the development team, then transition to a guiding role. However, one major challenge is the effective initiation of the project, especially when it's still in the analysis phase. It's crucial to ensure: All team members have the correct development environment. Source control is set up with proper user roles and rights. Necessary third-party components and database servers are accessible. Understanding team dynamics is equally important. The project manager must assess each team member's strengths, weaknesses, and working styles to facilitate effective collaboration. I recall a project where the client was still refining their concept. To keep the team engaged and prepared, we devised a "War Game" - a 5-day mini project simulating the actual project's conditions. This exercise included: Adhering to normal project processes. Developing features from a one-page list, without revisiting requirements. Encouraging creativity and problem-solving within a tight deadline. Presenting the outcome to the company, adding an element of competition. The results were astonishing. The team not only developed functional use cases but also thoroughly enjoyed the freedom and challenge. When presented to the client, their enthusiasm was evident, and it even helped refine their requirements. This "War Game" approach has since been successfully replicated in other projects, consistently yielding better-than-expected outcomes. It provides the team with momentum and creativity, crucial for the project's success. Hence, I recommend project managers carefully plan post-war game activities to maintain this momentum and harness team synergy effectively."
