Disclaimer I tend to find patterns everywhere, sometimes where they may or may not exist. It’s like when I tell my wife that someone looks exactly like a friend of ours, and she insists there’s no resemblance. I see connections in unexpected places—like between poetry and technology—though others might not agree! ​ Working in technology, we often talk about how hardware and software should seamlessly work together. We aim to create solutions where both elements blend perfectly to give users a smooth experience. I recently found this idea beautifully reflected in a poem by the Muslim mystic Mansoor Al Halaj, who wrote: I am He whom I love, and He whom I love is I: We are two spirits dwelling in one body. If thou seest me, thou seest Him, And if thou seest Him, thou seest us both. For me, this poem describes the ideal relationship between hardware and software. Just as two spirits dwell in one body, hardware and software should work as one, indistinguishable yet complementary. When users interact with a device, they shouldn’t have to think about the division between hardware and software—they should simply see the solution as a whole. The true innovation happens when both come together in perfect harmony, creating a seamless experience. Interestingly enough, many years ago ago, when I considered naming my own company, I chose the name Symphony Tek—because I consider harmony among different moving parts the most important thing.
