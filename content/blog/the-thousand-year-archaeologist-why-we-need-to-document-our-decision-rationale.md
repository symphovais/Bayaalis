In the fast-paced world of project management and organizational decision-making, it's easy to overlook the importance of thoroughly documenting the rationale behind our choices. Too often, decisions are recorded without the context or reasoning that led to them, leaving future stakeholders in the dark about why certain paths were taken. 

I like to use an analogy to illustrate this point: Imagine a new civilization digs up our records a thousand years from now. They find our decisions but have no clue why we made them. Without the rationale, they can only guess at our intentions. This highlights a critical gap: the failure to document the "why" behind our decisions. 

Documenting the rationale isn't just about keeping records; it's about providing a clear trail of thought that future team members can follow. It helps them understand why one requirement was prioritized over another, or why a particular architectural decision was made. Without this, we risk being misunderstood and having our decisions judged without context. 

This practice is especially crucial for management decisions. Often, we hear, "That's what management thinks," but rarely do we understand why. If management provided the rationale behind their decisions, it would offer insights into their thought process and enable better decision-making at all levels. This approach helps create a more homogeneous organization, where everyone can understand and align with the underlying thought processes and values. 

There is a common fear that transparency will lead to endless questioning and debates. However, embracing openness can lead to more cohesive and efficient workplaces. In a world increasingly built on open information architecture and open-source principles, why should organizational decisions be any different? 

By thoroughly documenting our hypotheses and the reasoning behind our decisions, we not only ensure transparency but also enable future teams to see the logic we followed. This can prevent the cycle of repeating mistakes or questioning past decisions without understanding the full picture. Rather than leaving our successors to play the role of archaeologists, let's make sure our thought processes are clear and accessible. 

By doing so, we foster a culture of openness and continuous learning. This will help everyone in the organization think in a similar way, ensuring that decisions are made with a shared understanding and aligned goals. So, let's be honest and thorough in documenting our decisions for the benefit of those who come after us, ensuring they understand not just what we decided, but why.
