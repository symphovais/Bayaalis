When I need to cook something, I often find myself staring into the fridge, looking for inspiration. It’s one of those moments when you want to make something special yet practical, something that pleases everyone but doesn’t require hours. In these moments, I think of chow mein—a dish that’s flavorful, adaptable, and a little challenging. It’s a perfect choice, and I know it’ll bring smiles around the table.
Once I’ve settled on chow mein, the process kicks in. I start by gathering ingredients, checking recipes for ideas, and remembering what worked well last time. This stage reminds me of product making, where you combine past experience with new inspiration. I set out my vegetables, protein, and noodles, knowing each part needs its own attention before they all come together. Each step has its place, building on the last, much like the structured stages in developing a product.
Cooking chow mein is all about timing and sequence. First, I stir-fry the vegetables to get that crunch, then set them aside. Then, it’s the chicken’s turn in the wok, followed by the noodles and sauce to bring everything together. The process feels deliberate, almost like crafting a product, where you need to get each component right before combining them into a cohesive whole.
As I serve the chow mein, I wait for that first taste test, watching my family’s faces to see their reactions. This is my feedback moment, where I see what works and what doesn’t. Maybe it needs a bit more spice next time, or perhaps there’s a request for extra veggies. Like in product making, this feedback helps me improve the “next version” of the dish. Each time I make it, it evolves, just like a product that improves through iterations and feedback.
For me, cooking is more than following a recipe. It’s about creativity, adaptability, and learning—a constant cycle of planning, testing, and refining. Just like making a product, it’s a journey of combining what you have, making thoughtful choices, and refining your approach with each iteration.
So, the next time you cook up a favorite dish, remember: behind every great meal—and every great product—is a story of careful planning, feedback, and the joy of creating something meaningful.
